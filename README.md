# mxm-tools

The tools the MXM instruments are tuned and measured with: the listener, the room simulator, the measurement harnesses and the listener HUD.

Part of the MXM collection: every instrument, effect and tool lives in its own repository under
[github.com/mxm-audio](https://github.com/mxm-audio), built on
[mxm-kit](https://github.com/mxm-audio/mxm-kit).

## Building

Rust 1.95 or newer. On Linux, install ALSA, JACK, X11, xkbcommon and a GL loader first.

```bash
cargo build --release
cargo test
```
